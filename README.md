# Fedora Silverblue but different

This is just a tiny little attempt at creating a version of Fedora Silverblue that for the most part tailored towards my own needs. It uses Universal Blue as a base, and contains some included packages, Nvidia drivers and the fsync kernel. 
At the moment completely non functional, as the current fsync version is newer than the nvidia drivers used here!
